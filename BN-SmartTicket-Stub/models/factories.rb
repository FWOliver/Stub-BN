  ARTIST_DESCRIPTION = [ "Psychocean, an art metal band from Italy. With grungy guitars, pissed off vocals and dark moodiness, Psychocean may sound like a few bands you already know of, and they turn this niche into something intelligent and cohesive. Luminescense is the latest output from this band, and my first experience with the work of this quartet. Although their sound is sure to alienate the more conservative prog rock fans, their sound is distinctly modern and pleasantly experimental, making for an experience that could have been even greater with a touch more variety", "The List has had a long documented love affair with Biffy Clyro. You see, from the moment we first heard stunning debut Blackened Sky in 2002 we knew the trio were onto something very special. So, forgive us for sounding like proud gushing parents when we say, we could pat their scruffy little heads for making a new record as majestic as Only Revolutions.", "Britney Jean Spears is an American recording artist, entertainer, dancer, actress, and occasional autho. OOOPs!", "The singer in the film BodyGuard", "She is a Diva"]
